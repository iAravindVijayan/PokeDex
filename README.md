# PokeDex

Welcome to the Pokedex project! This is a simple iOS application that utilizes CoreData for persistence storage and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It uses Combine for view-viewmodel binding and handles view inputs through the *process(input)* method. The viewmodel provides outputs that display values and interact with the view.

## Project Overview
The Pokedex application is designed for parents whose kids play Pokémon go. Users can see a random pokemon evertime the application is launched. Users can see the name, avatar and abilities of the Pokémon displayed. There is an option to save the displayed Pokémon and see a next Pokémon if the Kid doesn't like what is shown. This app delivers a seamless user experience by leveraging SwiftUI for UI creation and Combine for efficient data flow between the view and viewmodel. CoreData ensures that your data is stored securely.
